# noise-thesis

The purpose of this repository is to provide access to the code used in my MSc thesis "Applicability of Fully Mobile Measurements for Noise Maps" (included as pdf). The code required to reproduce the methodology of the study is included in steps in the root folder. Note that it cannot be run without the relevant data (may be made available upon request), and that it creates several new files the folder locations of which need to be created/adjusted when running locally.

*It is recommended to use ipynb provided md section headers for navigation in method notebooks.*

## Thesis Abstract
 Noise maps provide insight into the distribution of environmental noise throughout an area. This
 makes them an essential tool in communication regarding- and planning measures against- noise
 pollution. Currently, most noise maps that are produced are based on mathematical models which
 create detailed analysis but are unable to capture all of the complexity inherent to noise. This study
 evaluates the feasibility of a hybrid approach which allows modelled noise maps to be extended
 with simple to collect car-based mobile noise measurements.

 Anoise measurement setup was mounted to the roof of a car and measurements were collected in
 three different areas. Recording the noise measurements from a moving vehicle included interfering
 noise from both the collection vehicle and from wind hitting the microphone. To address this
 noise reduction, regression adjustments and data selection approaches were tested. The resulting
 models suffered from local inaccuracies and smaller value ranges when compared to reference
 models. Despite this, the models created were able to capture both general trends in the data and
 particularities of the areas measured, showing the potential of this hybrid approach given a larger
 collection of noise samples and more detailed model input.
